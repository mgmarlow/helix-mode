# Helix Mode

[![MELPA](https://melpa.org/packages/helix-badge.svg)](https://melpa.org/#/helix)

Postmodern keybindings for a premodern
editor: [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) keybindings in Emacs.

Helix is a modal text editor with keybindings similar to vi, but with
some [noteworthy
differences](https://docs.helix-editor.com/from-vim.html). Helix Mode
supports a small subset of Helix functionality with the goal of
recreating the editor navigation/selection experience in Helix while
leaving the hard problems (like directory navigation and searching) to
Emacs.  The result is a small keybinding layer that supports Vim-like
hjkl motion commands, while retaining Helix's selection-first model.

Helix Mode integrates nicely with `project.el`, `eglot`, and `xref`.

## Installation

Emacs >= 29.1 required.

Helix Mode is available on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started):

```lisp
(use-package helix
  :ensure t
  :config
  (helix-mode))
```

Or you can clone this repository and modify your load path:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/helix-mode")
(require 'helix)
(helix-mode)
```

### Global vs. local mode

You can enable Helix mode globally (e.g. for all buffers besides
minibuffers) via

```lisp
(helix-mode)
```

Alternatively, you can manually toggle Helix mode on/off in local
buffers by invoking `helix-normal-mode`:

```lisp
(helix-normal-mode 1)
```

## Configuration

### Multiple cursors (experimental)

Helix Mode does not come with support for multiple cursors
out-of-the-box. Instead, it provides extensions for the
[multiple-cursors.el](https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el)
package available on NonGNU ELPA. Provided that you have
[multiple-cursors.el](https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el)
installed, you can enable Helix Mode support with
`helix-multiple-cursors-setup`:

```lisp
(use-package helix
  :after multiple-cursors
  :config
  (helix-multiple-cursors-setup))
```

Enabling Helix multiple cursors support adds selection manipulation
keybindings that spawn multiple cursors
(e.g. `helix-multiple-cursors-select-regex`).

### jj as escape

Helix Mode supports remapping "jj" as escape for the purpose of
exiting Insert Mode. Invoke `helix-jj-setup` to activate jj-mode.

```lisp
(helix-jj-setup 0.2)
```

By default, `helix-jj-setup` configures a 0.2 second timeout that
waits for a second "j" keypress before canceling. You can configure
different timeouts by passing your desired timeout as an argument to
`helix-jj-setup`.

## Extension

### Keys

You can add new keys to the Helix keymaps via `helix-define-key`:

Example:

```lisp
(helix-define-key 'space "w" #'do-something-cool)
```

The first argument to `helix-define-key` is a Helix state. The valid
options are: insert, normal, space, view, goto, and window.

### Typable commands

You can create new typable commands (invoked via ":command-name") with
`helix-define-typable-command`.

Example:

```lisp
(helix-define-typable-command "format" #'format-all-buffer)
```

## Supported keybindings

Normal mode is the default mode. You can return to it by pressing
`ESC`.

## Roadmap

Helix Mode isn't designed to completely re-implement Helix in Emacs,
but rather serve as a compatibility layer that connects many of the
Helix keybindings to Emacs functions. I expect most users to still
rely on Emacs fundamentals like isearch, Eglot, consult, or vertico.

Goals:

- Core editing, navigation, and selection behaviors.
- A framework for surrounding contexts (word, paragraph, etc.).
- Tree-sitter navigation.
- Simple multiple cursors (via
  [multiple-cursors](https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el)
  integration).
- LSP (via [Eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot) integration).
- Extensibility for custom keybindings/typable commands.

Non-goals:

- Search (Helix Mode provides a simple search, but I think most folks
  are better off using [consult](https://github.com/minad/consult)).
- Pickers.
- Extensive configuration options like the Helix config/languages TOML
  files.
- Completion (I use
  [completion-preview](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/completion-preview.el)
  and it works perfectly with Helix Mode).
- Advanced multiple-cursors + selection behaviors. I'll do my best to
  support keybindings for multiple-cursors, but I'm unsure how deep I
  want to dive into overhauling the Emacs selection framework.
